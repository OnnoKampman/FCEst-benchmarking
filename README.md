Functional connectivity (FC) estimates are sensitive to choice of estimation method (e.g., sliding windows, MGARCH, Wishart processes, hidden markov models).
This project aims to design a range of benchmarks to determine what estimation method to use.

These benchmarks have been particularly developed to test the estimation methods included in the [FCEst](https://github.com/OnnoKampman/FCEst) Python package.
Results have been published in an article in Imaging Neuroscience (see `CITATION.cff`).

Many extensions of this project are possible, both in terms of adding more estimation methods and more benchmarks.
